# Migration to Python 3

The tool `2to3` was used as a first step.

The code relied extensively on features deprecated in python3.

* `zip()` now returns an iterable: in most of the code, this got replaced to `list(zip())`.
* `gzip.open` objects (and use in contexts) handled strings in IO. In most places, the calls were wrapped with `io.TextIOWrapper(gzip.open())`

The tests got a cleanup too.

There are minor differences such as string translation tables (used for complementes from `CGTA` to `GCAT`).
 The code will try to the python3 way, and if it fails, the python 2 way.
